on search screen below the search bar add a grid. each box in the grid will be filled by discovering all apps installed on the device. and some metadata about each app will be displayed in a modal window which can be opened by clicking the button in any of the grids cell, labelled by the app name to which the metadata belongs. all necessary userpermissions must be take for android. aim is to get network and device resource usage data for other apps on the same android device. the search bar allows search in the grid items. use skeleton loading for grid items and appropriate theme based on the light and dark toggle setting€€
