# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our project seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us responsibly.

**Please DO NOT open a public issue.**

Instead, please report it privately via [INSERT SECURITY CONTACT METHOD HERE, e.g., a specific email address, a security form, or GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature if enabled].

We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report as quickly as possible and will keep you informed about the progress of our investigation and remediation.

## Disclosure Policy

*   We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 3 business days.
*   We will provide a more detailed response and a plan for remediation within 10 business days.
*   We will notify you when the vulnerability has been patched and is ready for public disclosure.
*   We request that you do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have had a chance to address it.

## Supported Versions

We only provide security updates for the latest stable release of the project. Vulnerabilities found in older versions will generally not be fixed. We encourage all users to upgrade to the latest version to ensure they receive all security patches.

Thank you for helping to keep our project secure!
